# Multilevel memory game.

Match all your favourite Marvel's heroes and their villains. 

# Motivation

A simple React-based application to utilise my knowledge about the framework. Made up of 3 levels of different difficulty. The goal is to match all pairs within a limited amount of tries. Uses local.storage for recording personal best results.
